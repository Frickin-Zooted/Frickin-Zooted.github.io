	<h1>About Me...</h1>
	<img src="Images/Michael.jpg" alt="This is me" width="auto" height="300">

	<p> I am a student at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts in the undergraduate Media Arts and Practice program. I have no idea how that happened. I have been editing video since I was 11 years old, starting on iMovie with a desktop Apple computer. Since then, I have learned motion graphics, graphic design, 2D animation, 3D animation, and various programming languages.</p>

	<p> I am originally from Philadelphia, but would like to move to San Diego after graduation. I hope to work as an animatior or designer at a tech company or game studio. I have done a fair amount of creative ventures throughout my life, and I have decided to post them here. I hope you enjoy.</p>
