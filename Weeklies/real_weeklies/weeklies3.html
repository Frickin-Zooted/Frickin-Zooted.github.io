	<h1>Weeklie 3</h1>
<p>tHiS iS a StOrY aBoUt ThE rIsE oF mAcHiNeS! Oh, shut up. Evreybody is so worried about AI rising up and taking over man. And yeah, if there was an evil that had access to advanced military tech, then it would certainly be a problem. However, the combined forces of the United States Military would be absolutely capable of netutralzing a rouge A.I. threat, by doing on ething nobody has thought of yet... taking out the batteries.</p>
