	 <h1>Weeklie 8</h1>
	
<p>While artificial intelligence will have the potential to solve many issues facing humanity on a global scale, the development of AI should be regulated to protect the interests of the humanity it aims to serve. It is important to treat AI as a threat to humanity because the many possibilities for negative consequences. The dangers in AI lay in the ways human error can produce catastrophe and the potentials for AI to be vastly superior to humanity. The development of AI should be based on some fundamental principles, which both guide development and act as a deterrent stop rogue or malicious AI. As AI becomes more and more integrated with weapon systems, it important to understand their potential as non-lethal systems, as opposed to the ‘robot-killing machines’ many people are familiar with in Hollywood films. The concerns about the dangers of AI are prominent in the sentiments towards private sector. In a recent survey from Oxford, most people trusted the US Military to develop an AI over massive tech companies like Google and Facebook. This is mostly due to there recent privacy scandal, which has led many people to distrust giant tech companies. Also, the reason a company may be included to develop, and AI are far different than one developed by the military. It is not very as to what the those in the private sector aim to do with the AI they are currently developing. Whereas, the military has more distinct purpose to designing an AI. The applications of a military AI would be a weapon system, a combat stagey computer, or taking the place of a combat role. Whereas, development of AI in he world of business is solely for making or saving money.
