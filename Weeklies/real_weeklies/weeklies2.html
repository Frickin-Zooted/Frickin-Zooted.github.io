	<h1>Weeklie 2</h1>

<p>How is Ayn Rand's philosophy relevant today?</p>
	
	<p>I feel that in terms of the poltical world, this notion is true. All of the websites that people use to find information about issues are all tailored to them and their specific ideals. The ideas of free thought and free expression have been suffereing now, because of this notion, and at such a scale that so many people are radicalized about it. We had always seem seen websites of traditional insitution as an objective type of media, but they became something that more easily manipulatived than the forms of media which can before it. We think, oh computers can't lie and will steer us in the right direction, when in reality then are a much more powerful destabilsing force than stabilising force in society.</p>
