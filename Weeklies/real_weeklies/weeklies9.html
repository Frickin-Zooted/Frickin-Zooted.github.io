	 <h1>Weeklie 9</h1>

<p>AI’s should never have access to weapons of mass destruction. All AI’s should act in accordance with the international legal precedents set by the Geneva Convention and Nuremberg Trials. AI’s must not be allowed to consume organic material, as a power source or at all. Governments, organizations institutions, and individuals developing, utilizing, or possessing AI’s which violate these principles should be tried in an international crimes court. Governments, organizations institutions, and individuals developing, utilizing, or possessing AI’s which violate these principles should be tried in an international crimes court. AI’s and their associated parties must have their development pipelines approved by the government organizations responsible. AI’s must not be able to categorize humans based on race, religion, sex, age, physical health, or sexual orientation. AI’s and their associated parties must be routinely monitored by the government’s agencies responsible. AI’s that interface with the human mind should not be able to control it. It is likely that AI will be able to interface with the human to act as tertiary level of consciousness. This would be used to complete auxiliary functions that are better suited for mathematic calculation the human mind may not be capable of or to interface with devices and networks. For example, running a cooking timer or finding the weather. While this functionality is incredibly useful, it may come at a cost. It is imperative that devices can only receive input from the brain and not be able to control neural impulses. If this is the case, cyber-attacks or rouge AI could debilitate humans entirely or manipulate thought processes of populations of people. AI’s which violate these principles should be immediately terminated.
