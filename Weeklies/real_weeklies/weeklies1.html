	<p>What is the relationship between diagrams and meaning? </p>
	<p>For me, the reading makes in seem as thought diagrams assigning to things, atleast by forming relationships between things visually. In terms of non-art, it seems that diagrams are often something which aims to elucidate that ntaure of something, maybe empirically or quasi-emprically. However, art seems to to be for relationship between things the user may not expect to me related, but for the artist seems obviously or needed for the art to commuincate effectively.</p>
	
	<p>Diagrams help people make sense of maps, which can show how networks looks or operate. The can be the key for a subway map or meme flow chart of different crative names for dogs.</p>
