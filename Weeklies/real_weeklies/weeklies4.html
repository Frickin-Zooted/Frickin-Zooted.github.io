	 <h1>Weeklie 4</h1>
	
<p>New holiday season, new Call of Duty. Grab your Monster energy drink and get your Cool Ranch Doritos; because this one is the most innovative, probably, in the history of the franchise. This one is different, very different, but also the same… maybe - we don’t know just yet, but we can estimate. The new installment in the franchise is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, set to release on October 25th of this year. However, the Beta went public on September 14 and lasted through the weekend. Millions of players took part and gave feedback on the game with its several new additions and franchise firsts: A 32 versus 32 player ground war mode (to target fans of the Battlefield franchise); a new game engine; several more new game modes like 2 versus 2 Gunfight, 20 Player Domination, Night Vision, and Realistic Hardcore; and the most prominent change being a new hitscan/projectile hybrid system that drastically alters gun play - making it more skillful. The opinions of many game reviews by independent critics on YouTube are mixed, yet mostly overwhelmingly positive. However, many people from established game critic companies, like IGN and Kotaku, have met the game’s changes with mostly negative feedback and critique – especially in the game’s high fidelity to real and current world conflicts. These companies have even pressured developers to make changes to the game’s story because of the realistic and intense depiction of violence. Meanwhile, players and independent critics want the big companies to basically “butt out”. I’d use more professional language, but it wouldn’t capture the sentiment. People have called members of the interactive industry, whether critic or developer, “soft”, “disconnected” and a long list of other expletives said it long and intense internet rants. </p>
