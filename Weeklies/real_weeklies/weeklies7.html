	 <h1>Weeklie 7</h1>
	
<p>After playing the beta, I believe – and I’m not alone in thinking this – that this next game is going to look and sound amazing. The 32 v 32 is not as good as Battlefield; it is a long way off. However, what the Call of Duty has done well in the past, this game excels at. Innovative gun play, new and intoxicating game modes, and a commitment to reflect the reality of its campaign regardless of backlash. In all of this discussion of narrative and features that make a fps game having meaning, the most meaning a fps can exhibit is the reality of its world. Why consumers are fatigued of these aforementioned narratives is because they lie. The tell you there was a bright side to World War II. They try to convey evil in a world that we have no relation to. They try to instill fear with factions that are generic and hackneyed. They try to take a story further than it was ever meant to, push the characters to transform in to something unrecognizable from their original character, expanding the scope of the narrative to vast, unfathomable stakes with forced and empty dialogue, and they the tell you that the story still matters. And Critics let them, slapping 9/10’s of these games because this game just really makes you feel like a robot… a cog in a machine, that systematically spends $60 on the new installment in the franchise, hoping that one day it will tap into your nostalgia.</p>
