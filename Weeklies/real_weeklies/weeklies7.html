<p>What is the relationship between diagrams and meaning? </p>
	<p>- I belive that the difference is between the simple purlar and singular. The diagrams can illustrate overlay laps in meaning or multiple means through understanding the relationship between the meaning of objects and connections to other. Meaning for at an attempt to clarify and inform the dinotation of something. </p>
	<p>What is the difference between diagrams for art and non art?</p>
	<p> - </p>
<p>What is the relationship between diagrams, maps and networks? </p>
