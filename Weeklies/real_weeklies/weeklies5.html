	 <h1>Weeklie 5</h1>
	
<p>A first-person shooter is a unique and powerful narrative device because it allows interaction from the perspective of the main character. For a long time – before online multiplayer - main characters in fps games were absolutely or mostly silent; and even when the player had dialogue options. Gordan Freeman from the Half-Life franchise, Claude for Grand Theft Auto III, Master Chief from the Halo series, The protagonists from the Elder Scrolls and Fallout Games, and the protagonists from Call of Duty campaigns. This type of narrative design is incredibly difficult to execute, but when executed well is brilliant. That is why most of these franchises have lasted over a decade. Moreover, as this practice has been largely abandoned as lead narrative designers have pursued more cinematic and filmic story telling in games – which maybe they should not always do. What makes a game special is it ability to transport and relay players to experiences that are uniquely individualized, dynamically nonrepetitive, and deeply personal. Games are at their best when they are not expository in dictation and narration, but rather, expository in spatial discover. Films are on rails. Games are off the beaten path. Games force you to make decisions. Games confront you with dilemmas, problems, and consequences that you would not have had otherwise. Films suck you in as an observer. Games suck you in as an actor. In short, what makes a game good is that it isn’t a film. And early developers understood this. When developing the first and second Halo games, the Xbox exclusive that literally saved the console, the developers referred to Master Chief as a ‘husk’: “He isn’t a character, he is a husk, a suit of armor for the player to move around in.” Compared to the development of the notorious Halo 4, where developers refer to Master Chief as the exact opposite: a human being. Dehumanizing the main character of a game allows the player to play the role, while humanizing – if not done correctly – can creates games that play themselves.
